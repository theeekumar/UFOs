# UFOs
## Overview of Project
Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana create a webpage based on UFO sightings which consists of a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a list. This table has the ability to filter data based on certain criteria such as: date, city, state, country, or shape.
## Results
When the user opens the webpage and scroll down, they will see all the original data loaded into the table with no filters. On the left side of the screen, there is a filter search listing five different filters users can combine or use separately to sift through the data. The filters include: date, city, state, country, and shape.

Say the user wanted to filter the data by using a specific date such as 1/11/2010. The user would simply type the date they wanted to filter by and press "Enter" on their keyboard. When the user presses "Enter", only the data that has a date of 1/11/2010 will appear in the data table.

Wait! What if the user wanted to narrow down their data search even more? No problem! All the user has to do is simply enter in another filter and press "Enter". Continuing from the previous example of already filtering the date with "1/11/2010", the user wants to filter by shape as well. The user could enter any shape they want, however, we'll be using triangle for the shape in this example. Just simply type in triangle in the shape field for filter search and press "Enter". This will result in the table only displaying the data that is filtered by the date(1/11/2010) and the shape(triangle)!

## Summary
One drawback of this webpage is that the amount of original data could be larger. The original data only consists of data from the dates of 1/1/2010 - 1/13/2010. Also, most of the dates only have about 2-5 entries, further limiting the scope of the data. One recommendation I would make for further development would be to increase the amount of the data by expanding the date range and including more entries for each specific date. This would help the user grasp a better understanding of the data and give them more information to look through. Another recommendation I would make for further development would be to include an interactive navagation bar. This navagation bar could consist of various links like a UFO interest community page and a link to various outside resouces that can fuel the user's interest even more.
